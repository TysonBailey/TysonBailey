 My name is Tyson Bailey, I am a current ETSU student who is facisnated with computers. From a young age I began using computers to do all sorts of things. I have worked with multiple coding languages and still attempting to learn more, the ones I currently know pretty well include: Java, HTML, C# and SQL.
